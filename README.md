# 📈 Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a model to predict future stock prices based on historical data using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧾 Objective

Predict future stock prices using features such as:
- Opening Price
- Closing Price
- High
- Low
- Trading Volume

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Use Yahoo Finance / CSV dataset
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize features
   - Create time-based sequences for LSTM (if used)
3. **Model Selection**
   - Linear Regression (for basic modeling)
   - LSTM (for advanced time series prediction)
4. **Model Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Visualization of actual vs predicted prices
